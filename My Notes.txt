⚜️ Testing Technology

⚜️ SQA - Software Quality Assurance

⚜️ Testing :- Testing is nothing but to verify the functionality of the application 

⚜️ What is Software?
Software is a series of instructions for the computer that perform a particular task, called a program.

Or simply we can say Software is a collection of specialized programs.

E.g. Excel,Word,Amazon, What's App, Banking Application,CRM etc

⚜️ What is Software Testing?
Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free.

Software Testing is a process of executing the application with the intent of finding the defects by comparing the output behavior of the application with expected behavior (requirement).

In other words it’s comparing the actual behavior of an application with expected behavior. 

- There are two approaches to test the application.
1. Manual Testing
2. Automation Testing

--> Oligopoly - huge competition between multiple organisations/Companies
    ex- Amazon-Flipkart , Whatsapp-Telegram etc..

--> Robust - मजबूत, अभेद्य

--> Symbian Era - Time before the android/ios system introduced in mobile software. 
    keypad type mobiles

--> Y2K issue - Year 2000 issue

⚜️Q. Why you join as a Test/ Quality Engineer? 
                    or 
⚜️Q. Why you choose your carrier as software test engineer?

--->  What i understand, market follows the oligoploy mechanism 
means organisation requires to deiliver quality product to survive in market.
the main objective is to deliver quality product.
Here Two approaches can be implemented:
1. Design robust code
2. Remove all defects
approach 2 is practically possible
That is the significance of Testing

lets assume during symbian era nokia rules the market. 
when the technology gets changed to symbian to andriod Nokia even can't able to servive.
because nokia didnt accept the android for very first choice so they dont adopt updated technology.
Adaptability is the powerfull concept to achieve the quality. so that nokia fails to making right decision for surviving in oligopoly market. to servive in oligopoly market organisation has to deliver quality product. oligopoly means huge competition between multiple organisations/Companies.
to achieve the quality product, we have to focus on Testing.

According to my opinion Testing is backbone for software industry because every software product release with quality is done after testing only thats why i choose testing as a carrier.

⚜️Q. Who is responsible to deliver a quality product the developer or the test engineer?
---> Sir, Test engineer basically responsible for robust code.

⚜️ SQA - Software Quality Assuarance
         ----------------------------

⚜️ Q. What is software Quality Assurance (SQA)? 
                    OR
⚜️ Q. What do you mean by Quality?
---> Basically SQA stands for "Software Quality Assurance"

Definition :- Set of activities ensuring for quality of software product 
                                      OR
              To monitor and measure the strength of development process

All these planned actions necessary to provide adquate confidence that product is of the type of quality needed and expected by the customer.
--------------     --------

SQA Contains 5 Parameters:
--------------------------
1 Customer Requirement (Technical)
2 Customer Expectation (Technical)

3 Cost of software (Non Technical)
4 Risk management (Non Technical)
5 Timely deliverables (Non Technical)

1 Customer Requirement :- On what purpose customer has to produce software 
 ---------------------    i.e. Requrement of Customer

2 Customer Expectation :-  To meet Customer expectation primary & performance is needed
-----------------------   Customer Expectation = Customer Requirement + Extra Features

3 Cost of software :- Price of Software
-------------------

4 Risk management :- If something goes wrong in the software we have to modify it 
------------------    with free of cost is called Risk Management.

5 Timely deliverables :- We have to deliver Software on time.
----------------------
All these parameters define the 'SQA' morever in the old era 'Customer Requirement' was the prime target but now a days 'Customer Satisfaction' is priority.

Customer satisfaction = Customer Requirement + Extra Features 


'SQA means to monitor and measure the strength of development process'.

Software Process = A software related issues solved by software engineers through 
software engineering process.

⚜️ Q. What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
---> 1. SDLC is acronym of "Software Development Life Cycle"
2. It is also called as software development process
3. SDLC is framework which defines task performed at each step in the software development process
4. SDLC is process followed for software project within a software organization. It contain detailed plan describing how to develope, maintain, repair or alter and enhance specific product.
the life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software & overall development process.

⚜️ Q. Explain SDLC Generic phases?

---> Generic means one then next then next
A typical SDLC consist of following 3 phases

1. Customer Requirement & Analysis :-
------------------------------------

a. Customer Requirement (Requirement Gathering) :-
------------------------------------------------
- Customer Requirement is the most imp stage in SDLC. Business Analyst collects the requirements from the Customer/Client as per the clients business needs and documents the requirements in the Business Requirement Specification and provides the same to Development Team.

- Note: Document name may vary from one Organization to another, Some examples are Customer Requirement Specification (CRS), Business Requirement Document (BRD) etc

- Suppose Our Planned Software is not intended for a single customer and the software product for multiple customers then Business Analyst or Business Team collects Requirements from the Market and also evaluate Other similar products in the Market 

- Key Role in this phase is Business Analyst and Outcome of the phase is "Business Requirement Specification"


b. Analysis :- 
-------------
- Once the Requirement Gathering is done the next step is to define and document the product requirements and get them approved by the customer. This is done through SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document. SRS consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

- Key people involved in this phase are Project Manager, Business Analyst and Senior members of the Team. The outcome of this phase is Software Requirement Specification.


2. Design, Coding, Testing :-
----------------------------

a. Design :-
-----------
- In Design phase Senior Developers and Architects, they give the architecture of the software product to be developed. It has two steps one is HLD (High Level Design) or Global Design and another is LLD (Low Level Design) or Detailed Design, 

- High Level Design (HLD) is the overall system design, covers the system architecture and database design. It describes the relation between various modules and functions of the system. 

- Low Level Design (LLD) is the detailed system design, covers how each and every feature in the product should work and how every component should work. 

- The outcome of this phase is High Level Document and Low Level Document which works as an input to the next phase Coding. 


b. Coding :- 
-----------
-  Developers (seniors, juniors and fresher) involved in this phase, this is the phase where we start building the actual software and start writing the code for the product. 

- If design is developed in detailed and organize manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hussle.

- The outcome of this phase is Source Code Document and the developed product. 


c. Testing :-
-----------
- Once the software is complete then it is deployed in the testing environment. The testing team starts testing (either test the software manually or using automated test tools depends on process defined in STLC) -----#(STLC- Software Testing Life Cycle)

- Testing is done to verify that the entire application works according to the customer requirement. 

- During this phase, Testing team may find defects which they communicate to developers, the development team fixes the defect and send back to Testing for a re-test. This process continues until the software is Stable, and working according to the business needs of that system. 

- In this stage product is tested where product defects are reported, tracked , fixed and retested until the product reaches the quality standard defined by SRS (Software Requirement Specification).


3. Maintenance :-
--------------- 
- After successful testing, the product is delivered (deployed to the customer for their use), Deployment is done by the Deployment/Implementation engineers and Once when the customers start using the developed system then the actual problems will come up and needs to be solved from time to time.
- Fixing the issues found by the customer comes in the maintenance phase. 100% testing is not possible – because, the way testers test the product is different from the way customers use the product. Maintenance should be done as per SLA (Service Level Agreement) 

a. Correction :-
---------------
- When some fault occure in product after deployment then modify it i.e. correction

b. Adaptive :-
------------
- Adaptive is concept of acceptance.
- Adopt from old version and add some new features called as Adaptive Eg. Mobile phones

c. Re-engineering :-
------------------
- Reprocess it means Re-engineering

d. Enhancement :-
----------------
- Future Requirement

- Requirement gathering is most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. Collects the input from customer in this stage.
In requrement gathering process the document is created by senior team member called as "BRS" (Business Requirement Specification)

- Once the requirement gathering is done the next step is clearly define the product requirement & get them approve from customer. This is done through SRS i.e. Software Requirement Specification.
SRS consist of all the product requirement to be designed & developed during the project life cycle.

- One copy of SRS goes to development team & one to testing team on same day. so they both start their work simultaniously.

- When copy of SRS comes to testing team then tester performs Test case Design (TCD) & development team work on it to produce software application.

- Developed Application is then given to the tester for testing.

- Tester test that application according to test case design i.e 'Test Case Execution' 
In this way Testing and Development both processes starts simulteniously

- Fish model explains the mapping between different stages of development and testing
- In fish model we have to do testing from the project initiation node to maintenance node because of this the model is expensive and time consuming Apart from this, using fish model we can deliver a good quality software to the customer. The Skeleton of this model is look like Fish so named as "Fish Model"

Phase 1 :-
----------
Information gathering takes place & here the BRS(Business Requirement Specification) is prepared.

Phase 2 :-
----------
In this phase analisys takes place. In this place Business Analyst people prepare SRS(Software Requirement Specification) document.
SRS is combination of Functional Requirement Specification And System Requirement Specification. During this phase testing people go for review.

Phase 3 :-
---------
This is Design phase, Here HLD i.e High level Design & LLD i.e Low Level Design documents are prepared by developer team. 
Here the testing people are going for prototype review.


Reviews :-
--------
A document level testing technique during this review, the responsible
people are estimating the completeness & correctness of corresponding
Document
There are different kind reviews for validate above BRS SRS and Design documents.
Walkthrough
In this review system, responsible people Study a document from 1st line to last line
2. Inspection
Search for a specific issue in a document (Without Intimation).
3. Peer Review 
Compare a document with other similar document
4. Informal Review
It doesn't follow any process to find out any defects in document. In this review, they just review and give informal comments.
5. Technical Review
Fun specifications will be reviewed and checked whether it is suitable to product.


Reviews in BRS/SRS :-
-------------------
Are they Right Requirements?
Are they Complete Requirements?
Are they Achievable Requirements?
Are they Reasonable Requirements?
Are they Testable Requirements?

Reviews in Design:-
------------------
After completion of Analysis & their reviews the designer category
people develops HLD & LLD’s are conducts reviews on the documents for completeness & correctness.
The designers prepare these questions on the HLD & LLD’s.
Are they understandable designs?
Are they meeting the right requirements?
Are they complete designs?
Are they followable designs?
Are they handling errors?

Phase 4 :-
-------- 
After completion of design & their reviews, the programmers start coding.
Coding is set of software program written by development team to construct a physical software.
What is Program
Program: - A set of executable statements is called a program. Software consists of multiple programs. A program consists multiple statements.
In this phase, the programmers prepare programs & then test each program using
White Box Testing Techniques.
White Box Testing
It is coding level testing technique used to check completeness and correctness of program.
A program level testing technique. In this technique, the responsible people are verifying the internal structure of the corresponding program. i.e developers
White Box Testing techniques are also known as Unit Tesing/Open Box Testing / Glass Box Testing / Clear Box Testing

Phase 5 :-
---------
This is Testing phase. Testing is done to verify that the entire application works according to the customer requirement. 

Tester review the whole application called as Black Box Testing

black box testing defines the presence of defects as well as absence of defects in code.
This is build level testing technique.
During this testing, test engineer validates the internal functions with respect to external interface.
Also known as ‘System and Functional testing’.
Tester doesn’t need to know about internal code written  by developer.

Phase 6 :-
---------
This is maintenace Phase. 
After successful testing, the product is delivered (deployed to the customer for their use), Deployment is done by the Deployment/Implementation engineers and Once when the customers start using the developed system then the actual problems will come up and needs to be solved from time to time.
Fixing the issues found by the customer comes in the maintenance phase. 100% testing is not possible – because, the way testers test the product is different from the way customers use the product. Maintenance should be done as per SLA (Service Level Agreement)

* White Box Testing
---------------------

It is coding level testing technique used to check completeness and correctness of program.
A program level testing technique. In this technique, the responsible people are verifying the internal structure of the corresponding program. i.e developers
White Box Testing techniques are also known as Unit Tesing/Open Box Testing / Glass Box Testing / Clear Box Testing

There are 4 White Box Testing Techniques:
1.Basis Path Testing
2.Control Structure testing
3.Program technique Testing
4.Mutation Testing
These Techniques are applicable only for Programs.

1.Basis Path Testing:
During this test the programmers concentrate on the execution of
programs without any runtime errors. To conduct this test, the corresponding
programmer follows the below approach.
Write a program with respect to LLD (Low Level Design)
Draw a flow graph for that program.
Run that program more than one time to cover all areas.
Eg If Else program….This program should be run 2 times executable.
° One time to check whether if condition is satisfied or not
° Next time to check whether the else condition is satisfied or not, without any runtime errors

2. Control Structure Testing:
During this test, the corresponding programmer concentrates on
correctness of program execution in this test, they verify every statements of
program execution. In this test, they verify every statements input state & Output
state.
Eg: Debugging

3. Program Technique Testing:
During this test, the programmers concentrate on the execution
speed of a program. If the execution speed is not reasonable, then programmers
perform changes in the structure of the program without disturbing functionality
of the program. 

4. Mutation Testing:
During this test, the corresponding programmers estimate completeness & correctness of a program testing. Total req, successful and failed req

* Black Box Testing
--------------------
- This is Testing phase. Testing is done to verify that the entire application works according to the customer requirement. 
Tester review the whole application called as Black Box Testing
- This is build level testing technique.
- During this testing, test engineer validates the internal funtion with respect to external interface.
Also known as ‘System and Functional testing’.
- *imp* During black box testing we validate system and functional test with Three dimentional approach with respect to customer requirement to satisfy Business logic.
Tester doesn’t need to know about internal code written  by developer.

Functional Testing and Non functional testing
Functional Testing
------------------
1. Behavioral  Coverage
2. Input domain Coverage(BVA And ECP)
3. Error handling Coverage
4. System level Coverage
5. Calculation Based Coverage
6. Backend coverage / Database Testing

Non Functional
----------------
1. Compatibility testing
2. Parallel Testing
3. Installation testing
4. Globalization testing
5. Security Testing
6. Performance Testing
7. Sanitation Testing
8. Recovery Testing

Q. What is Static testing and Dynamic Testing?
Static testing :-
---------------
- Static testing is verification testing technique where we test the requirement doc and design doc prior to software  being developed i.e. testing without giving any i/p.
- Testing is done before code developed.
- This done during analysis and  design phase using reviews techniques.
It is about prevention.
- Main objective of Static testing is to improve the quality of software product by finding errors in early stages of development cycle.
- Also known as ‘Non execution testing’ or ‘Verification Testing’.

Dynamic Testing :-
-----------------
- Dynamic testing is validation testing where we test the developed software i.e. testing with i/p and checking the expected results.
- Testing is done after code developed.
- This testing done by white box testing or black box testing.
It is about Cure.
- Main Objective Dynamic testing Software product work as per business requirements.
- Also known as ‘Execution Testing’ or ‘Validation Testing’.

Verification and Validation :-
-----------------------------
- Without Verification validation is not possible and without validation quaity software is not achievable.

These both testing techniques are to check that software product is meeting the customer requirements.
- Static Testing ---Verification
- Dynamic Testing– Validation
- Verification + Validation---SDLC
- Verification– Quality Assurance
- Validation- Quality Control
